Infeckshun is a simple arcade shoot-em-up. Our plucky hero is a virus, bent on the destruction of its human host.

##The Cast
### Our hero

Use the arrow keys to move around. Use the spacebar to shoot enemies.

### Enemies

Watch out for these guys. They’re not terribly bright, but you’ll want to dispatch them quickly before they can gang up on you.

### Clone cells

You can rupture these cells by hanging out inside for a couple seconds, sending clones out to attack the human host.

### Ammo cells

Like clone cells, ammo cells rupture after a couple seconds of contact, leaving bullets behind. You’ll need plenty of bullets to fight off your enemies.
